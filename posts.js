Count back, anaesthetise
Colours burnt into my eyes
Life for you is shades of grey
Help me, help me find my way

Lost, lost, and never found
Hide your secrets, settle down
I am young and I am naive
Tell me something I will believe

Take me, take me far away
From this city's soul decay
Hid away 'til I was eighteen
Only saw colours on a TV screen

Skinny jeans and sunglasses
A fashion statement for the masses
What you're doing makes me sick
Over hyped and generic

Shine, shine, like the sun
Spread your warmth through everyone
I asked you why people die
You said we all had a design

Slide into the sea
Landslide comin' down on me
I said I was into you
You said you were into me

You never answer on the phone
With your nicotine lips and your heart of stone
I look for you by the underpass
Looks like this love wasn't meant to last

You said you reap just what you sow
So tell me where does your garden grow
You said in time the pain would pass
Looks like the end is here at last

Burn, burn, like a star
Burn a hole in every heart
Strung out on a trail of blood
Who knew the stars were not enough?

Smile, smile if you can
If you can't, I'll understand
See these stitches in my eyes
Smash computers, kill rock stars

Purge the past and waste my mind
Leave no scent or trace behind
One day when you bury me
When I wake up, what will I see?

Down, down, underground
Dig for fire, dig for sound
What is on the radio?
Cause I would like to say hello

Crawl, crawl through the dirt
Jesus, show me what you're worth
Can't you just send us a sign?
Tell us all that we're doing fine

Nights for sitting in the dark
Days for lying in the park
Wake me up from my sick dream
A requiem for this dead scene

You never answer on the phone
With your nicotine lips and your heart of stone
I look for you by the underpass
Looks like this love wasn't meant to last

You said you reap just what you sow
Well tell me where does your garden grow
You said in time the pain would pass
Looks like the end is here at last

Count back, anaesthetise
Colours burnt into my eyes
Life for you is shades of grey
Help me, help me find my way

Mother, can't you help me now?
Cause I've been drowning in the sound
Lying on the motorway
Writing songs and wasting away

Samsung Galaxy S11 release date and price

We saw the Samsung Galaxy S10 release alongside the Samsung Galaxy S10e and Galaxy S10 Plus in late February 2019. Since Samsung tends to release its phones in yearly cycles, we expect to see the Samsung Galaxy S11 release in February or March 2020.

That may mean we hear about it at MWC 2020, or it may be a touch earlier as one rumor suggests we might see it on February 18. It's quite early to hear about an actual launch date though, so we'd take that news with a big pinch of salt.

The Galaxy S10 cost $899 / £799 / AU$1,349 for its cheapest storage size, and went all the way up to $1,149 / £999 / AU$1,699, when it released.

We would expect the Samsung Galaxy S11 price to be a small increase on this, as the Galaxy S10 was pricier than the Galaxy S9. 

Taking into consideration the usual price increases on Galaxy S handsets between generations, we'd expect to see it cost around $1,000 / £900 / AU$1,500 for the cheapest version, and even more for more memory.

Having said that, we're talking about the standard Galaxy S11 here, but a rumor suggests there might be a Samsung Galaxy S11 Lite (if it doesn't launch earlier as the S10 Lite), in which case there might be a cheaper option for buyers who don't have a grand to spend on a smartphone.
Samsung Galaxy S11 design and display

According to one of the more reputable tipsters on the web, the screen sizes of the Galaxy S11e, Galaxy S11 and Galaxy S11 Plus will be 6.4 inches, 6.7 inches and 6.9 inches – and they're all going to come with curved screens.

They might also have a 120Hz refresh rate, offering smoother interactions than the 60Hz found on the S10 range. That theory is based on a 120Hz mode being spotted in a beta for Samsung's smartphone software. There's no guarantee the feature will arrive on the Galaxy S11 range, but it seems a likely candidate.

We haven't heard much else about this aspect of the Galaxy S11 yet, but a browser test for an unknown Samsung phone believed to be an S11 model points to a 20:9 aspect ratio. That would make it more widescreen than the 19:9 Galaxy S10 (or taller when held in portrait orientation).

It could also use a new screen tech, as Samsung has trademarked the name SAMOLED, which sounds like a new take on the AMOLED screens used by its phones, though we don't know how SAMOLED would differ.

Paranoiacs in the Bitcoin community have long speculated that the US government may have cracked the virtual currency’s privacy model, that once made it popular with the online drug trade. For example, over the years various people have suggested or wondered (sometimes as a joke) if the NSA actually created Bitcoin in an effort to trap criminals.

Unbelievably, these people were on to something. Sort of. According to a cache of documents from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden published by The Intercept on Monday, the NSA has actually been attempting to track Bitcoin users since 2013.
    
Bitcoin was the spy agency’s “#1 priority,” the documents show, though the agency was also targeting two other digital currencies, one of which was a Bitcoin predecessor called Liberty Reserve. According to the outlet, the NSA leveraged its ability to scoop up huge amounts of internet traffic in an attempt to identify Bitcoin transactions and users. Documents suggest that passwords and device IDs were also collected. The documents also suggest that the NSA may have used XKeyscore—a system the agency used to search the vast amounts of personal information like emails that it collected—to round out information on Bitcoin users.
    
The core of the surveillance effort was a system codenamed MONKEYROCKET that involved a product (possibly a piece of software, possibly a VPN) described in documents as a “non-Western Internet anonymization service” with users in Iran in China. Instead of keeping Bitcoiners’ traffic safe from spies, however, this software actually funneled data to the NSA for analysis. The other part of the system, The Intercept reported, was a tap on an unspecified foreign cable site.
    
The NSA’s data-guzzling approach here differs significantly from how most blockchain forensics are conducted: By looking at the blockchain, the public ledger that tracks every Bitcoin transaction. On the Bitcoin blockchain, users are represented by strings of numbers and letters called addresses. Anyone can see funds moving between addresses, and even data mine the ledger for connections between addresses. But normally, the identity of the person behind the address is difficult if not impossible to determine without external sources or investigation.
    
We don't know how successful the NSA’s attempt to crack Bitcoin’s privacy model was, although it seems pretty sophisticated in The Intercept’s snapshot from five years ago. Regardless, it’s long been known that Bitcoin is not the most private cryptocurrency around—its blockchain is completely transparent and viewable to anyone, after all. Coins employing obfuscation techniques or advanced cryptography, like Monero and ZCash, have more recently attempted to improve on Bitcoin’s privacy model.
    
The realization that the feds have been trying to track Bitcoiners for years is no doubt concerning to anybody who relies on Bitcoin’s privacy guarantees (and vindicating to the NSA conspiracy theorists), and it’s a good example of how being extremely paranoid doesn’t necessarily mean you’re completely wrong.

When is a quote from a historical figure not to be trusted? When it is tweeted by a Trump.

In truth, all historical quotes tweeted out by politicians should be treated with the caution of the most stringent factchecker – and regularly are, particularly when the words in question are supposedly by Winston Churchill.

Nonetheless, this week Ivanka Trump fell into a familiar trap, provoking widespread glee.

On Thursday evening, after a final (for now) dramatic day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against her father, the first daughter wrote: “‘A decline of public morals in the United States will probably be marked by the abuse of the power of impeachment as a means of crushing political adversaries or ejecting them from office.’

Democrats say Donald Trump abused the powers of his office when he pressured Ukraine to investigate a political rival and a baseless conspiracy theory about interference in the 2016 election.

Republicans say the charges are a sham and the hearings a political circus designed to bring down a president without recourse to the ballot box.

So Ivanka’s tweet was on message. But, alas, it wasn’t Tocqueville.

As historians with Twitter accounts made clear, it was in fact a paraphrase drawn from the Frenchman’s seminal work Democracy in America, which was published between 1835 and 1840 and is, according to the Guardian’s Nicholas Lezard, “still relevant [as] everyone can find something in it that is recognisably correct”.

The incorrect lines Ivanka found were from the 1889 book American Constitutional Law by John Innes Clark Hare.

It was also swiftly determined that Trump had most likely not found the 130-year-old lines on Google Books, or even while paging through a dusty tome ordered from the Library of Congress in order to mine the history of her father’s predicament for aperçus fit to toss over canapés at some Kalorama or Georgetown salon.

Instead, Innes Clark Hare’s words were published on the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal on 25 October, under the headline “This impeachment subverts the constitution”.

Trump was at least in good company: as a WSJ correction now makes clear, the two constitutional lawyers who wrote the piece in question also misattributed the quote, thanks in part to its appearance under Tocqueville’s name in Deschler’s Precedents of the United States House of Representatives, a catchily titled leviathan by House parliamentarian Lewis Deschler published in 1977.

As of Saturday morning, the tweet remained on Ivanka’s Twitter page. If she fancied any further reading, Twitter was of course happy to supply it.

Joshua D Rothman, a history professor at the University of Alabama, was among those who pointed out that Innes Clark Hare deployed the paraphrase of Tocqueville in writing about the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. That process, in 1868, saw the venal and unpopular 17th president avoid removal from office by one vote in a Senate trial.

“The actual quote in context claims Andrew Johnson was wronged,” Rothman wrote. It was now being used, he added, by a woman he called “a beneficiary of nepotism in defense of a man who settled what is only his most recent fraud case less than two weeks ago”.

One, two three, four

Down in a hole there are so many ways
To find yourself some light
It' always the miracles keep waiting all you like
Ain't got no time to waste I know the end is near
And if I run away I'll always end up here

[Hook]
Walking away from the things I adore
Telling the truth for once I'm sure
It's always a sign when you feel yourself bleed
I'm walking away from all I need

I can't escape the tragedy that always brings me down
If I could eliminate those things that make me frown
Take all the baggage that follows me around
And just disintegrate burn it to the ground
[Hook]

I'm walking away!

Walking away!
